				 <h1> Jobs </h1>
				 <p> Nebulous is an early stage VC-backed startup building a new kind of cloud storage platform. Powered by blockchain tech, we are able to securely create a marketplace for data that drives prices down and performance up. For data storage, our platform is faster, more reliable, more secure, and 1/10th the cost of traditional cloud data storage. </p>
				 <p>Sia, the platform, is one of the pioneers of the blockchain space, showcasing its power by decentralizing the cloud and bringing it years into the future. The team is on the front lines of decentralization, having spoken at prominent conferences such as Scaling Bitcoin.</p>
