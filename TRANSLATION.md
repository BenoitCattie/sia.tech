Translation Guide
=================

Thank you for contributing your translations!

Translations that have been requested by the community can be found [by filtering open issues labeled "translation needed"](https://github.com/NebulousLabs/sia.tech/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22needs+translation%22). If you can contribute translations in these languages, we would greatly appreciate it!

To get started, copy [`en.yaml`](/i18n/en.yaml) and rename it to `<language-code>.yaml`. `<language-code>` is the [ISO 639-1](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_language_codes.asp) code for the language.

Go through the file and translate each `translation: "___"`. If you cannot translate this line, please leave it in English and add a comment at the end of the line like so `# TODO: i18n: translate this`. You can email the translated file to hello@sia.tech with the subject `[i18n] adding <language>`.

If you have corrections to a translation, locate the corresponding `<language-code>.yaml` file in [`/i18n/`](/i18n/), make a copy, find the mistake, and correct it. You can email the corrected file to hello@sia.tech with the subject `[i18n] <language> correction`.

We encourage you to open a PR on [the site's GitHub](https://github.com/nebulouslabs/sia.tech) if you're familiar with git.
