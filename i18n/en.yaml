### paragraphs ###
- id: about_p1
  translation: "The idea of Sia was originally conceived at HackMIT 2013. What if you could liberate the unused storage space of the world and unite it into a worldwide free market for data?"

- id: about_p2
  translation: "Sia leverages the capacity of blockchain technology to enable distributed networks to reach consensus in a secure and trustless way. Cryptographically secured smart contracts ensure the encryption and transfer of data with no possibility for a third party to interfere in any way."

- id: about_p3
  translation: "Sia is a new approach to cloud storage platforms. Instead of all datacenters being owned and operated by a single company, Sia opens the floodgates and allows anyone to make money by renting out their hard drive. Data integrity is protected using redundancy and cryptography."

- id: about_p4
  translation: "The promise of Sia is a decentralized network of datacenters that, taken together, comprise the world's fastest, cheapest, and most secure cloud storage platform. Today, being a major cloud storage player requires having datacenters, building trust within the market, reaching customers, and competing with giants such as Amazon, Google, and Microsoft."

- id: about_p5
  translation: "Breaking into this market is a multi-billion dollar endeavor. The long term goal of Sia is to be the backbone storage layer of the Internet."

- id: about_p6
  translation: "We believe data should be free. We aim to liberate the unused bits of the world and construct the largest storage superserver on the planet."
