- id: about_p1
  translation: "The idea of Sia was originally conceived at HackMIT 2013. What if you could liberate the unused storage space of the world and unite it into a worldwide free market for data?"

- id: about_p2
  translation: "Sia leverages the capacity of blockchain technology to enable distributed networks to reach consensus in a secure and trustless way. Cryptographically secured smart contracts ensure the encryption and transfer of data with no possibility for a third party to interfere in any way."

- id: about_p3
  translation: "Sia is a new approach to cloud storage platforms. Instead of all datacenters being owned and operated by a single company, Sia opens the floodgates and allows anyone to make money by renting out their hard drive. Data integrity is protected using redundancy and cryptography."

- id: about_p4
  translation: "The promise of Sia is a decentralized network of datacenters that, taken together, comprise the world's fastest, cheapest, and most secure cloud storage platform. Today, being a major cloud storage player requires having datacenters, building trust within the market, reaching customers, and competing with giants such as Amazon, Google, and Microsoft."

- id: about_p5
  translation: "Breaking into this market is a multi-billion dollar endeavor. The long term goal of Sia is to be the backbone storage layer of the Internet."

- id: about_p6
  translation: "We believe data should be free. We aim to liberate the unused bits of the world and construct the largest storage superserver on the planet."

# URL: /lts.html
- id: lts_explanation1
  translation: "Sia has a special line of releases called the Long Term Support releases. LTS releases most notably do not include new features until those features have been in production for a long time without revealing any new or unexpected bugs. This means that important features (such as instant wallet unlocking) do not make it into an LTS release until several months after they are released to the general public."

- id: lts_explanation2
  translation: "All Sia releases are thoroughly tested. However, the reality is that bugs do make it into production. It is our goal that none of our releases have bugs, but until we are able to consistently achieve that goal we provide the more slowly-upgrading LTS releases for users and developers who require stability. Unless stability is critical, we recommend using our <a href=\"../apps\">production releases</a>, which are generally faster, more user-friendly, and more featureful."

  translation: "THINGS YOU WANT TO KNOW"

### sia ###

- id: faq_siah
  translation: "Sia"

- id: faq_sia1q
  translation: "How are files securely stored on the Sia network?"
- id: faq_sia1a
  translation: "Sia uses a combination of erasure coding, encryption, and blockchains to ensure that files are secure on the network. No host can view the files that it is hosting, and files can withstand large network outages without corrupting."

- id: faq_sia2q
  translation: "What happens if a file host goes offline?"
- id: faq_sia2a
  translation: "Sia uses Reed Solomon erasure coding, which means that a large percentage of file hosts can go offline without causing file corruption."

- id: faq_sia3q
  translation: "How stable is Sia?"
- id: faq_sia3a
  translation: "The Sia consensus protocol has been thoroughly reviewed, and is unlikely to change dramatically in the future. No major vulnerabilities have been found in the Sia consensus protocol since the initial launch on June 7th.The client software is firmly in beta. Most serious bugs have been eliminated, but there are still rough or frustrating elements to the user experience. There may also be lingering bugs that would put coins or files at risk. Use with caution. There is no warranty on the software. Restarting the software is usually a good way to resolve unexpected issues."

- id: faq_sia4q
  translation: "What is a file contract?"
- id: faq_sia4a
  translation: "A file contract enables a host and a renter to make an agreement about a file; the host agrees to store a file for some duration of time, and then gets paid some money for doing so. The renter pays all of the coins up front, and the blockchain acts as escrow. If the host keeps the file and submits a proof of storage at the end, the host will get the payment. Otherwise, (depending on the terms of the contract), the payment is returned to the uploader. All payments need to be made in Sia’s local currency, the siacoin."

- id: faq_sia5q
  translation: "Can I contribute, or build on Sia?"
- id: faq_sia5a
  translation: "Yes! We would love that. All of Sia's code is 100% open sourced and can be found on our github.Special thanks to bitspill, fornax, autumnalscooter, and pmknutsen for helping out, as well as other devs who have made issues or submitted pull requests."

- id: faq_sia6q
  translation: "What's the difference between Sia and Nebulous Labs?"
- id: faq_sia6a
  translation: "Nebulous Labs is the company, Sia is the product."

### siacoins ###

- id: faq_siacoinsh
  translation: "Siacoins"

- id: faq_siacoins1q
  translation: "What is the difference between Siacoin and Bitcoin?"
- id: faq_siacoins1a
  translation: "Sia uses a cryptocurrency, Siacoin, to enable decentralized payments. Siacoin can be thought of as an extension to Bitcoin that adds support for file contracts. Like Bitcoin, Siacoin uses a blockchain, and is powered by \"proof-of-work\" mining. However, Siacoin and Bitcoin are not in direct competition. Bitcoin is a general-purpose currency, while Siacoin exists only to enable the Sia network."

- id: faq_siacoins2q
  translation: "Why does Sia need its own currency? Couldn't it use a payment processor like PayPal?"
- id: faq_siacoins2a
  translation: "This would make it much harder for clients to pay hosts directly. In addition, Sia creates a large volume of very small transactions (i.e. micropayments; think less than 1¢), which traditional payment processors are not designed to handle. Finally, using a blockchain also makes it possible to enforce contracts in a cryptographically secure way."

- id: faq_siacoins3q
  translation: "How can I get siacoins?"
- id: faq_siacoins3a
  translation: "You will need bitcoins to acquire siacoins. The most common place to get siacoins is Poloniex. There is also a trading thread on bitcoin talk and a trading channel in our slack."

- id: faq_siacoins4q
  translation: "How many siacoins will exist?"
- id: faq_siacoins4a
  translation: "The number of siacoins created each block is (300,000 - height). The genesis block has a height of 0. After height 270,000, all blocks will have a reward of 30,000 siacoins. The current number of siacoins can be found at explore.sia.tech"

- id: faq_siacoins5q
  translation: "How much does it cost to store data?"
- id: faq_siacoins5a
  translation: "The price is determined by a free market of users and providers. As of January 2016, storage is about $2.25/TB/month with 6x redundancy."

- id: faq_siacoins6q
  translation: "What is the difference between Siacoin and Siafund?"
- id: faq_siacoins6a
  translation: "The two are different assets. The Siafund grants you access to a portion of the hosts income. If you buy a siafund for $200, it means that over the lifetime of the Siafund you expect to earn $200 back (plus interest). If Sia achieves its goal of cloud storage domination, each Siafund will earn probably somewhere between $10,000 and $250,000 for their owners each. The discount represents risk that Sia will never grow that large.The Siacoin is used to buy storage on the Sia network, and it's base value is derived from that."

### wallet ###

- id: faq_walleth
  translation: "Wallet Usage"

- id: faq_wallet1q
  translation: "How does wallet encryption work?"
- id: faq_wallet1a
  translation: "The first time you run Sia, you will need to initialize a wallet. You can click 'Create Wallet' in the app. You will be given a secure 29 word passphrase that will be needed to unlock the wallet in the future. If you ever lose your wallet file, you can use the 29 word phrase to recover siacoins that had been in the wallet."

- id: faq_wallet2q
  translation: "What is wallet locking?"
- id: faq_wallet2a
  translation: "Locking is part of the encryption. When you first open a wallet, it will be locked. Coins cannot be spent while the wallet is locked. The miner, file manager, and host will also be disabled while the wallet is locked."

- id: faq_wallet3q
  translation: "Can I choose my own password?"
- id: faq_wallet3a
  translation: "Currently, you cannot choose your own password. People typically overestimate their ability to create strong passwords, and many people have lost coins due to theft as the result of having a weak password. For this reason, there is no support for user-generated passwords in the default Sia software."

- id: faq_wallet4q
  translation: "Can a hacker steal my coins?"
- id: faq_wallet4a
  translation: "The private keys only exist in memory while the wallet is unlocked. All private data is encrypted using the wallet password before being saved to disk."

- id: faq_wallet5q
  translation: "Why is there a list of addresses?"
- id: faq_wallet5a
  translation: "Most wallets display different addresses to the user one at a time. We simply show them all to you at once. It's good practice to use a new address for every transaction."

- id: faq_wallet6q
  translation: "Why hasn't my balance updated after a transaction?"
- id: faq_wallet6a
  translation: "Your transaction will be included in the next block. The time it takes to mine each block is targeted at 10 minutes. Additionally, if your wallet is new, it may still be behind in downloading block headers."

- id: faq_wallet7q
  translation: "Are wallet users anonymous?"
- id: faq_wallet7a
  translation: "Yes, for the most part. Technically it's permissionless - Sia does not require any personal information for use of any of its services."

- id: faq_wallet8q
  translation: "How often should I back up my wallet?"
- id: faq_wallet8a
  translation: "There's no need to, as long as you have stored your seed / passphrase in a secure location. Don't lose that!"

### host ###

- id: faq_hosth
  translation: "Host Usage"

- id: faq_host1q
  translation: "How do I become a host?"
- id: faq_host1a
  translation: "The first step is forwarding your ports. Once your ports are forwarded, you can announce the host and begin collecting file contracts. The announcement can take a few hours to propagate the network."

- id: faq_host2q
  translation: "How do I forward my ports?"
- id: faq_host2a
  translation: "The default ports that need to be forwarded are :9981 and :9982. Recent versions of Sia include upnp, which will automatically forward ports for most people but does not work for everyone. portforward.com contains more information."

- id: faq_host3q
  translation: "Sia says my ports are not forwarded, but they are."
- id: faq_host3a
  translation: "Sia sometimes falsely believes that your ports are not forwarded. To get around this, you can use 'siac' to announce a specific url. This announcement does not verify that your ports are forwarded, allowing you to get around the error."

- id: faq_host4q
  translation: "I am not getting any contracts."
- id: faq_host4a
  translation: "If you are not getting any file contracts, it is probably because your price is too high, your wallet is locked, your ports are not forwarded, or you never properly announced the host."

- id: faq_host5q
  translation: "What price should I use?"
- id: faq_host5a
  translation: "There are some crude tools for estimating competitive price of storage on the network. Anything over 100 siacoins per GB per month is unlikely to get storage contracts."

- id: faq_host6q
  translation: "Will hosts be held responsible for uploaded content?"
- id: faq_host6a
  translation: "Because the files are encrypted, hosts cannot know what files they are hosting and thus cannot be held accountable for hosting those files. However, if the host receives a DMCA takedown request then it is the host's responsibility to acquiesce."

### miner ###

- id: faq_minerh
  translation: "Miner Usage"

- id: faq_miner1q
  translation: "Is there a mining pool?"
- id: faq_miner1a
  translation: "No, but there are at least 2 mining pools in development. An official mining pool is in development, and at least one third party is developing a mining pool for Sia.There is no official ETA for any mining pool."

- id: faq_miner2q
  translation: "What card should I buy?"
- id: faq_miner2a
  translation: "AMD cards tend to perform a lot better than Nvidia cards. The Fury X has been reported as a cost-effective card."

- id: faq_miner3q
  translation: "How long will it take to solo mine blocks?"
- id: faq_miner3a
  translation: "Depending on the card, each video card can expect to mine between 2 and 10 blocks per month, with very high variance."

- id: faq_miner4q
  translation: "I mined a block but my balance is still 0"
- id: faq_miner4a
  translation: "Similar to Bitcoin, coins that you have mined will not be spendable for 144 blocks. Typically, this is 24 hours though hashrate fluctuations can cause confirmations to take longer at times."

- id: faq_miner5q
  translation: "What hashing algorithm does Sia use?"
- id: faq_miner5a
  translation: "Sia uses BLAKE2b, and an implementation of a GPU miner is available for download on our Github."

### files ###

- id: faq_filesh
  translation: "Files"

- id: faq_files1q
  translation: "How do I upload a file?"
- id: faq_files1a
  translation: "In the GUI, click on the folder icon on the top right corner of your wallet."

- id: faq_files2q
  translation: "I uploaded some files but they aren't showing up"
- id: faq_files2a
  translation: "You can try running 'siac' in the command line. Siac is a command line utility that you can download from the Sia repo. Tutorials on how to use it can be found here as well. https://github.com/NebulousLabs/Sia/releases/latest"

- id: faq_files3q
  translation: "Can I remove a file after uploading to Sia?"
- id: faq_files3a
  translation: "Coming soon!"

- id: faq_files4q
  translation: "How do I download a file?"
- id: faq_files4a
  translation: "Click on the file and a download icon will pop up in the top right corner."

- id: faq_files5q
  translation: "Can I see how many times a file has been downloaded?"
- id: faq_files5a
  translation: "No, as downloads happen outside of the blockchain. Some hosts may report the volume of activity that they get on a file, but the hosts can easily lie about such metrics. Other platforms such as the Sunfish sharing platform may have methods for tracking metrics such as downloads."

- id: faq_files6q
  translation: "Can others see my files on Sia?"
- id: faq_files6a
  translation: "No. All files uploaded by siad are first erasure coded and then encrypted. Only someone with the file metadata will be able to view the original file. As an additional protection, information like the exact filesize is also hidden from someone without the metadata."

- id: faq_files7q
  translation: "Can I share files with others on Sia?"
- id: faq_files7a
  translation: "Yes. Files can be shared publically and privately. All files uploaded to the Sia network are erasure coded and then encrypted. Someone will only be able to decrypt and fetch the files if they have metadata about the files. This metadata is stored in something called a ‘.sia’ or a ‘siafile’. By sharing the siafile associated with a file that’s been uploaded to Sia, you give someone the ability to download that file. To share files privately, you can give the siafiles to people you trust. They will be able to download the file, and as long as they don’t share it, nobody else will. You can share files publicly by putting the associated siafiles in a public place."
